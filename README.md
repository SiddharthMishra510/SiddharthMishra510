- 👋 Hi, I’m @SiddharthMishra510  aka Sid

👀I am looking for an opportunity where the quality of the product, as well as the software, is of great importance. 
- I want to learn and grow in an environment where SOLID principles and clean coding both are an integral part of software development.
- I am confident that, with my experience and passion, I’d be able to make a positive impact and contribute to the success of the team.

🌱I have spent more than 2 years working for startups where I was able to significantly improve my knowledge of OOP as well as the Unity Engine. 
- I have worked extensively on mobile games, developing networked-multiplayers, platformers, board games as well as 2D/3D action games. 
- Building great gaming experiences is as important to me as developing scalable, maintainable, and efficient game software.
- Experienced in both managing a team and self-directing for complex projects, I am into solving problems before they are noticed. 

- 💞️ I am very enthusiastic about game design and I have been designing games since I was 10 years old. I like to read books about Clean Code and programming.
